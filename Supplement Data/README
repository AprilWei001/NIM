Supplementary data include 10 items, Data S1-S10.

Data S1: UKBB phenotype annotation. 
Data S2: RHE-mc results in simulated data. 
Data S3: RHE-mc results with Ancestry+MAF+LD annotations and NIM PCs included in covariates applied to 96 UKBB phenotypes
Data S4: RHE-mc results with Ancestry only annotation and NIM PCs included in covariates applied to 96 UKBB phenotypes
Data S5: RHE-mc results with Ancestry+MAF+LD annotation without NIM PC in covariates applied to 96 UKBB phenotypes
Data S6: Fine mapping FDP in simulated data. 
*Pay attention to the subtle difference in the headers of Data S3-S6 -- they are not the same*
Data S7: 112 credible NIM sets and credible NIMs
Data S8: SnpEff annotation of all unique credible NIMs
Data S9. Stratified LD score regression results in simulated data using LD score from 1KG
Data S10. Stratified LD score regression results in simulated data using LD score from UKBB
