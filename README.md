UKBB SNP QC: SNPs with plink with flags --maf 0.001 --geno 0.01 --hwe 1e-7 --keep .fam (ukbb wb unrelated)
Whole genome simulation for any genetic architecture on tabla: /home/aprilwei/projects/nimHeretability/wgSim/simAllArchitecture.sh
This file takes UKBB in-sample allele frequency (for simulating MAF based architecture) and in-sample ldscore (for simulating LD based architecture) as input.
